## FB5

#### Summary

When fuzzing programs that accept more than just random inputs,
like website URLs, it's crucial to adapt our fuzzer to produce
realistic yet incorrect URLs for testing functions related to URLs.
Attempting to test such functions with entirely random inputs could
take years to stumble upon a correct HTTP URL. An effective strategy
involves taking valid inputs and strategically altering specific
characters to create URLs that are incorrect but closely resemble
the correct format. This approach allows us to generate a wide
array of input variations. When these diverse inputs are combined
with a runner function, they ensure comprehensive coverage of every

## FB7

#### Summary

The chapter addresses the inefficiencies of the simple_grammar_fuzzer in the Fuzzing Book, highlighting
its poor time complexity with large inputs and frequent inaccuracies in symbol or parenthesis counts.
To remedy this, the introduction of deviation trees is proposed. These trees track the pathways of grammar
expansions, enabling the monitoring of each grammar statement's cost. This methodology empowers us to preset
expansion limits and determine when to terminate the grammar, effectively controlling input size and reducing evaluation time.

#### Reflection & Action

Incorporating deviation trees revolutionizes grammar fuzzing by imposing input size constraints,
transforming it into a practical testing method. Without such limits, grammar fuzzing risks becoming
an endless process with increasingly large inputs, leading to significant time inefficiencies. This
innovation ensures that inputs remain manageable in length and can be processed within reasonable
timeframes, greatly enhancing the utility and applicability of this testing technique.

# Week 8

## SE8

#### Summary

In this section of Software Engineering at Google, the focus is on the strategic application of
rules to optimize code quality. Rules serve as essential guidelines, distinguishing what should

requests and workflow standards could lead to a more consistent and efficient team. Such changes would unify our team,
streamlining the collaborative process in team-based software engineering without the need for laborious efforts to seek
team members' assistance in specific aspects.

## FB8

#### Summary

In specific scenarios of fuzz testing, relying solely on a grammar fuzzer may not suffice due to the inherent need
for rules in input generation. To address this, employing a parser becomes essential to transform a string input
into a derivation tree. A Predicate Expression Grammar (PEG) parser serves this purpose, parsing until it identifies
a rule that aligns with its query. An example is provided below:

```python
class PEGParser(Parser):
    def parse_prefix(self, text):
        cursor, tree = self.unify_key(self.start_symbol(), text, 0)
        return cursor, [tree]
```

While PEGParser is effective for finding a single match, in many cases, it is desirable to identify all matches,
necessitating a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) parser. This type of parser allows for matching all parts of an input
during parsing, as illustrated by the following example:

```
class CFGParser(CGFParser):
    def parse(self, text):
        cursor, states = self.parse_prefix(text)
        start = next((s for s in states if s.finished()), None)

        if cursor < len(text) or not start:
            raise SyntaxError("at " + repr(text[cursor:]))

        forest = self.parse_forest(self.table, start)
        for tree in self.extract_trees(forest):
            yield self.prune_tree(tree)
```

#### Action & Reflection

These parsers represent a crucial advancement in creating derivation trees from specific seeded inputs.
This capability enables the identification of necessary grammars for simulating inputs in future fuzz testing,
automating the input-taking process for subsequent fuzzing. In the context of Chasten, integrating PEG and CFG
parsers enhances the tool's performance by facilitating the
importation and seamless implementation of these parsers. These parsers contribute to the creation of concise,
branched grammars, leading to faster grammar processing times. The incorporation of more complex parsers allows
for the composition of grammars with finer details, without compromising external structures or the program's
overall significance.
