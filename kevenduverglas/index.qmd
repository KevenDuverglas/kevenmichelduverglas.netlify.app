# About the Author

Hello my name is Keven Michel Duverglas, and I am Sophmore at Allegheny. A fun fact about me is that I can speak three language.
I am looking forward to collaborating with everyone throughout the semester and get to know the dev-team well.

#### Summary


There's an exploration of what exactly
"software engineering" means, and the reading distinguishes it not only
from fields like programming and computer science but also
shedding light on how it stands in relation to other disciplines
with "engineering" in their title. It also speaks on the matters regarding the 
growth of organizations and release new software. 

#### Reflection

I am firmly convinced that this book provides insights into crafting efficient code.
These insights offer practical advice on how to refine one's
coding practices for the long term. One of the standout aspects of the book is its emphasis
on reducing redundancy in code, which not only makes the code cleaner but also easier to maintain. 

#### Use-Case

This book provides the tools for us to run code, allowing Chasten to evaluate and utilize it within a test-case setting.

#### Summary

The initial chapter introduces core concepts of software testing, addressing the necessity,
methods, and assessment of software testing. Using Python and interactive notebooks, readers
are familiarized with these principles. The chapter provides a basic my_sqrt() function, which
aims to compute the square root of a given number. A brief overview
of understanding Python's structure and syntax is provided, followed by a practical demonstration of
running the function. Readers can directly experiment with the
function and observe results, while also making edits to the provided content. And this can be done through a Jupyter 
Notebook.

#### Reflection

This chapter provided a comprehensive look into the world of software testing,
offering both theoretical knowledge and hands-on tools for practical implementation.
One of the intriguing parts for me was the example on testing the my_sqrt() function. Implementing a square root
function might appear elementary,
but the emphasis on the Newton–Raphson method highlighted the process behind it.

#### Use-Case

The first chapter of the Fuzzing book does a solid job of laying down the basics.
It sets the stage for the kind of deep thinking we'll need when we start building the
Chasten tool. By mixing theory with hands-on examples, readers get a good grasp of what's
ahead. This foundation is key, making sure everyone's on the same page as we dive into the
more complex parts of the book.
It's clear that this chapter is an essential starting point for everything that follows.
